# Siganture-Forgery-Detection-Using-GAN
This is a project dealing about signature forgery detection using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) and using an additional Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for classification.

The detection of signature forgery is crucial in maintaining the authenticity of signatures in applications that are of significant importance, such as in banks, legal documents, and verifying documents The model considers two primary elements: the generator creates apparently realistic forgeries and the discriminator aims to detect actual signatures.
The main aim for the generator is to produce forgeries that are sufficiently convincing to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator is committed to improving its ability to classify the signatures with accuracy. 
Our results show that this GAN-based method effectively detects signature forgeries, achieving impressive accuracy and surpassing traditional techniques. The generated forgeries are often indistinguishable from real signatures, highlighting the exciting potential of GANs in creating synthetic data and uses CNN to classify the signatures.

In conclusion, the proposed GAN-based method demonstrates significant advancements in signature forgery detection by leveraging the interplay between a generator and a discriminator. This approach not only produces forgeries that closely mimic authentic signatures but also enhances the ability of the discriminator to accurately classify them. The integration of CNNs further boosts the model's performance, providing a robust framework that surpasses traditional techniques. These findings underscore the potential of leveraging synthetic data generation and deep learning technologies for secure and reliable applications in banking, legal systems, and signature verification. Our model gives an accuracy of 92%.
